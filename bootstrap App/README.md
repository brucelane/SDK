# bootstrap App

To be played on Gekkota, a bootstrap App includes the following files :

- a bootstrap file (eg. *player.xpf*); 
- a manifest file (see description on *manifest.md page*);
- resources needed by the App (eg. *medias* directory);

The *manifest.md* page describes the different sections *metadata*, *launcher* and *cache* of the manifest file.  
For more information about bootstrap App, see the different use case  in the *examples* directory.
